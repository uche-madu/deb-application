# 🗜️⚙️ DEB Application Repository 🔩🧰
![Terraform Workflow](https://github.com/uche-madu/deb-application/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

***This is one of two repositories with code for the entire DEB Project. While this repository focuses on the application code such as Airflow DAGs, the [DEB Infrastructure repository](https://github.com/uche-madu/deb-infrastructure) focuses on provisioning cloud resources. This separation of concerns via separate repositories aims to follow GitOps Principles.***
